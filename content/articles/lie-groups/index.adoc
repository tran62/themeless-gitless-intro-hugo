== Definition and examples

A Lie group is a _group_ (set with an operation of composition) and a _topological manifold_ (space that locally resembles Euclidian space, but which may be curved or distorted on the global level ), such that the law of composition is _continuous_ (small changes in the elements being composed produce small changes in the result).

. Simplest example: set of all rotations of a circle.

. More challenging example: group of all rotations of tri-dimensional space that preserve a fixed origin.

== History

_Ideas of Lie:_

. The solution of differential equations by classical methods of integration was possible only because the equations remained unchanged under a continuous family of transformations.

. Infinitesimal transformations derived from a given continuous group are not closed under composition; instead, they are closed under an operation known as the _bracket_, written [x,y]. The _bracket_ operation satisfies two basic identities:

$ [y,x]= -[x,y] $

$ [x,[y,z]] + [y,[z,x]] + [z,[x,y]] = 0    $   (Jacobi identity)

== Wilhem Killing and Elie Cartan

Killing associate with eaxh simple Lie algebra a geometric structure known as a root system. He uses methods of linear algebra, in particular the characteristic equation of a linear transformation, to study and classify root systems, and then derived the structure of the corresponding Lie algebra from that of the root system.
Cartan extends Killing's ideas to the theory of representation of simple Lie algebras - the different ways of producing the same algebra as an algebra of matrices.

== Modern work

THe global structure of Lie groups took a major step forward with the work of:

- Hermann Weyl(1939) - proof of the complete reducibility from a special class, the _irreducible_ representation.
- Claude Chevalley (1957) - finite Lie groups
- Simon Donaldson (1989) - 4-dimensional Euclidian spaces possesses non standard differentiable structures because of unusual feature of the Lie group of all rotations in that space.
