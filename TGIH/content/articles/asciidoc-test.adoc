== Asciidoc

=== Example 5. Constrained bold, italic, and monospace

It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

Type `OK` to accept.

That *_really_* has to go.

=== Example 6. Unconstrained bold, italic, and monospace_

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle**__mania__**!

Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

=== Example 7. Highlight, underline, strikethrough, and custom role_

Werewolves are allergic to #cinnamon#.

##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

=== _Example 9. Smart quotes and apostrophes_

"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

A ``std::vector```'s size is the number of items it contains.

All of the werewolves`' desks were a mess.

Olaf had been with the company since the `'00s.

=== _Example 11. URL macros with attributes_

[TIP]
The link: macro prefix is not required when the target starts with a URL scheme like https:. The URL scheme acts as an implicit macro prefix.
[CAUTION]
If the link text contains a comma and the text is followed by one or more named attributes, you must enclose the text in double quotes. Otherwise, the text will be cut off at the comma (and the remaining text will get pulled into the attribute parsing).

=== _Example 21. Document header with attribute entries_


== level 1
=== _Example_ 22. Article section 

= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title

== Lists

* List item
** Nested list item
*** Nested list item
* List item
 ** Another nested list item
* List item

== Images

You can use the imagesdir attribute to avoid hard coding the common path to your images in every image macro. The value of this attribute can be an absolute path, relative path, or base URL.
If the image target is a relative path, the attribute‚Äôs value is prepended (i.e., it‚Äôs resolved relative to the value of the imagesdir attribute). 
If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the attribute‚Äôs value is not prepended.

_Example 38. Block image macro_

image::sunset.jpg[sunset]

image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]

.A mountain sunset

Two colons following the image keyword in the macro (i.e., image::) indicates a block image (aka figure), whereas one colon following the image keyword (i.e., image:) indicates an inline image. (All macros follow this pattern). You use an inline image when you need to place the image in a line of text. Otherwise, you should prefer the block form.

_Example 39. Inline image macro_

Click image:play.png[] to get the party started.

Click image:pause.png[title="Pause"] when you need a break.
